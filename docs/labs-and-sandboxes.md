# Labs and Sandboxes

I always feel curious about how things on the web work.

- Can I automatically send users customized emails/sms upon their submission of Google forms?
- What happens after I submit my Common App?
- How does the university's Shibboleth SAML work? How about CAS, OAuth, OIDC? How to integrate MFA?
- How can external tools sync grades back to Canvas (the learning management system)?
- How to securely support file upload, store, and retrieval (signed url/streamed file)?
- How to defend cross-site attacks? Are CSRF tokens necessary?
- ... ...

"Labs" and "sandboxes" are what I often have fun with by integrating/implementing things behind these questions. They then become tools I consider using in my future web apps.
